# Set

Changes or defines the value of a variable.

## Syntax

```pebakery
Set,<%Variable%>,<Value>[,GLOBAL | PERMANENT]
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Variable | The name of our variable. |
| Value | The value of the variable. Setting this argument to `NIL` will delete the variable. |

### Flags

The following flags are mutually exclusive.

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| GLOBAL | Store the variable in global memory for the lifetime of the build process. This will allow other scripts to reference and/or modify this value. If the `Variable` is already defined the value will be overwritten. |
| PERMANENT | Permanently stores the value of this variable by writing the definition into script.project's [Variables] section. If the `Variable` is already defined the value will be overwritten. |

## Remarks

Unless the `GLOBAL` or `PERMANENT` flag are defined the `%Variable%` scope is confined to the running script.

Alternately, Variables can also be defined before execution by placing the definitions in the script's `[Variables]` section. See Example 2 for details.

The `Set,...,PERMANENT` command should not be used to change interface control values. Use the `InterfaceWrite` command for this purpose.

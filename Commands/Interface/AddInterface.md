# AddInterface

Loads variables from another interface section into the local scope.

## Syntax

```pebakery
AddInterface,<ScriptFile>,<Interface>,<Prefix>
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ScriptFile | The full path of the script containing the interface. **Hint:** Use `%ScriptFile%` to reference the current script.|
| Interface | The name of the section containing the interface you wish to read. |
| Prefix |  Prefix for the interface variables. Prefixes protect you in the event the interface you are loading has the same component names as the main [Interface] section. Variables are loaded as `%<prefix>_<componentName>%`. |

## Remarks

The `AddInterface` command is required in order to read all the components in your script in the event you make use of multiple interface "pages". You can also use `AddInterface` to access the values of components in another script, as long as you know the component names.

As long as your control names are unique or you use a `Prefix` you can load as many interfaces at once as you need.

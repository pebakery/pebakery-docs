A circular button that can have only one radio button selected on the interface at a time.

## Syntax

```

| Visibility | `True`/`False` - Show or Hide the control. |

## Remarks

The `Value` of the radio button can be read by referencing the control `Name` as a variable. Ex. `%RadioButton1%` or by using the `ReadInterface` command.
